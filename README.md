* `long int* prev_load`: Previous CPU load
* `struct cpu_stat *cpu_stat`: Pointer to the current CPU stats


**Return Value:**
* `double`: CPU load in percentage to be used in the next iteration

This function is used to print the CPU usage statistics. It uses `sysconf` to get the number of cores (iteraretes through the `/proc/stat` file to count the number of CPUs).
The function uses the `get_stats` function to get the CPU usage statistics. It then sleeps for the desired time delay. It then uses the `get_stats` function again to get the CPU usage statistics. It then uses the `calculate_load` function to calculate the CPU load. It then prints the CPU load in percentage.
If graphical is called, It prints two bars if the load is less than or equal to 0.01%, an additional one bar for every 0.1 increase upto 1, an additional one bar for every 1 increase upto 10, and an additional one bar for every 10 increase upto 100. As can be seen through this code: 

    if (prev_load > 0.01 && prev_load <= 1.00) {barCount = (int)(prev_load * 10); }
    else if (prev_load > 1.00 && prev_load <= 10.00) {barCount = prev_load + 10;}
    else if (prev_load > 10.00 && prev_load <= 100.00) {barCount = prev_load / 10 + 20;}

The function returns the CPU load in percentage to be used in the next iteration.
</details>

`void getMemory(int pipefd_mem[2])`
<details>
    <summary>getMemory Description </summary>

**Parameters:**
* `int pipefd_mem[2]`: Pipe to write to

**Return Value:**
* `void`

This function is used to print the memory usage statistics. It uses the `<sys/sysinfo.h>` library, and the `sysinfo` struct to get the memory usage statistics.
It prints the virtual memory usage in GB. It calculates the memory usage using the following: 

    long long phys_mem = sys.totalram * sys.mem_unit;
    long long phys_used = (sys.totalram - sys.freeram) * sys.mem_unit;
    long long virt_mem = sys.totalram * sys.mem_unit + sys.totalswap * sys.mem_unit;
    long long virt_used = (sys.totalram - sys.freeram) * sys.mem_unit + (sys.totalswap - sys.freeswap) * sys.mem_unit;

Each of the variables are in bytes, which is why they are divided by 1024^3 to get the value in GB.

</details>


`void memoryPrint(char memory_arr[1024][1024], int samples, bool graph, int i, double* prev_virt, struct mem_stat *mem_stat)`

If the graphical output is needed, the function will print the graphical output for the memory. For every 0.01 GB change, the function will print an additional symbol based on whether the memory usage is increasing or decreasing.
The function returns the virtual memory usage in GB to be used in the next iteration.
</details>

`void finPrint(bool sys, bool user, bool graph, bool sequen, int samples, int tdelay)`
<details>
    <summary>finPrint Description </summary>

**Parameters:**
* `bool sys`: Boolean to indicate if system information is needed
* `bool user`: Boolean to indicate if user information is needed
* `bool graph`: Boolean to indicate if graphical output is needed
* `bool sequen`: Boolean to indicate if sequential output is needed
* `int samples`: Number of samples to be taken
* `int tdelay`: Time delay between samples

**Return Value:**
* `void`

This function is used to print the final output. It prints the starter() at the beginning and the ender() at the end. If sequential is false, it uses `printf("\033[H \033[2J \n");` to clear the screen.
It prints the CPU usage statistics and the memory usage statistics. Based on which flags are called.
It also prints the graphical output for the CPU and the memory if the graphical output is needed. If sequential is true, the screen is not cleared after each iteration, and the output is printed beneath the previous output.
It also declares and frees the memory for the char arrays that will be used to store the graphical output for the CPU and the memory.
</details>

`int main(int argc, char *argv[])`
<details>
    <summary>main Description </summary>

**Parameters:**
* `int argc`: Number of arguments
* `char *argv[]`: Array of arguments

**Return Value:**
* `int: 0`

This function is used to parse through the arguments passed to the program. It uses `strcmp()` to compare the arguments to the flags. It also uses `atoi()` to convert the arguments to integers if needed. The command line arguments are defined at the beginning of the usage page. It passes through the arguments and sets the boolean values to true if the flag is present. It also sets the number of samples and the time delay between samples if they are present. It then calls the `finPrint()` function to print the final output. If the user does not pass any arguments, the program will print the usage and system page.

**Note: If invalid arguments are passed, none of the commands are run, and the program will print:** 
    
        Please enter valid arguments

**However if at least one valid argument is passed, the program will run the valid arguments and ignore the invalid ones.**
</details>

## Examples + Additional Notes

Multiple arguments can be used at the same time. For example, the following command will generate the system usage statistics with graphical output and will take 5 samples with a time delay of 2 seconds between each sample:

`./mySystemStats -s -g -sa=5 -td=2`

The following command will generate the user usage statistics and will take 2 samples with a time delay of 8 seconds between each sample:

`./mySystemStats -u 2 8`

## How I solved the problem

 My program uses the fork() system call to create child processes, which are executed concurrently. It uses pipes to send information from the parents to the child, and vice-versa.
